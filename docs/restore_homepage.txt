# Homepage Restore Instructions

## Current State
- Main homepage (index.html) is redirecting to About page (/about.html)
- Original homepage content is backed up as index_backup.html

## To Restore Original Homepage

### Method 1: Using Command Line
```bash
cp index_backup.html index.html
```

### Method 2: Manual Replacement
1. Delete the current index.html file
2. Rename index_backup.html to index.html

### Method 3: Edit index.html manually
Replace the content of index.html with:
```
---
# Feel free to add content and custom Front Matter to this file.
# To modify the layout, see https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults

layout: home
title: Home
banner: "/assets/images/banners/background_pic.jpg"
---
```

## Files Modified
- index.html (redirects to about.html)
- index_backup.html (contains original homepage)
- _config.yml (navigation menu modified to show only About)

## To Restore Navigation Menu
In _config.yml, replace the header_pages section with:
```
# header_pages:
#   - index.html
#   - archives.html
#   - categories.html
#   - tags.html
#   - about.md
```
(Comment out or remove the current header_pages section)

## After Restoration
- Homepage will show the original Jekyll theme homepage
- About page will still be accessible at /about.html
- All other pages (archives, categories, tags) will work as originally designed
- Navigation menu will show all original links

## Date Modified
October 1, 2025

## Jekyll Server Restart Required
Since _config.yml was modified, you need to restart the Jekyll server:
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Restart server
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Notes
- The redirect was implemented to temporarily make About page the main landing page
- Navigation menu was modified to show only About page in header
- No permanent changes were made to the Jekyll theme or configuration
- All original functionality can be fully restored
- Original navigation settings are preserved as comments in _config.yml
